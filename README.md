### [What](#what)
A web server, created using [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)), serves as a [content farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm). It automatically generates random quotes and presents them to the user in a [doom-scroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) environment, aiming to generate ad revenue.

### [Why](#why)
Why not? Just kidding.

To keep it simple: one day, while experimenting with my favorite algorithm, the [Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model), I had an idea. I downloaded a large collection of quotes and applied the Markov model to them. After generating the quotes, I needed to find a purpose for them. After much thought, I decided to create a content farm. This concept is fully automated and future-proof, allowing me to run Google ads without much maintenance post-deployment, while providing users with an endless stream of content.
