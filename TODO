make index have infinite scroll-through the images
pre-load next 10 images in local storage for fluent navigation


make api endpoint where the user can read about how things are generated (including parts of code)



allow users to vote for quotes



add loader to the page because images need to buffer (Buffering...)


use arrows keys to scroll through images
use enter key to go to next image
use backspace key to go to previous image
use space key to save/share image (raw image, not a url to it)

soft-code a limit on previous/back clicks to once per 500ms

disable 'Next' button and show spinner when the buffer is empty or loading


put quote in head meta tag
